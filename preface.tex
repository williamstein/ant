\chapter*{Preface}

This book is based on notes the author created for a one-semester
undergraduate course on Algebraic Number Theory, which the author
taught at Harvard during Spring 2004 and Spring 2005.  This book was
mainly inspired by the \cite[Ch.~1]{sd:brief} and Cassels's article
{\em Global Fields} in \cite{cassels:global}
