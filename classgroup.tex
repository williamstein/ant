\chapter{Finiteness of the Class Group}\label{ch:classgroup}
Frequently $\O_K$ is not a principal ideal domain.  This chapter is
about a way to understand how badly $\O_K$ fails to be a principal
ideal domain.  The class group of $\O_K$ measures this failure.  As
one sees in a course on Class Field Theory, the class group and its
generalizations also yield deep insight into the
extensions of~$K$ that are Galois with abelian Galois group.

In Section~\ref{sec:theclassgroup}, we define the class group and
state the main theorem of this chapter.  We then illustrate the
implications of this theorem in detail for the field $\Q(\sqrt{10})$,
proving that it has class group of order $2$. Next, we prove several
geometric lemmas, building very heavily on ours results from
Chapter~\ref{discnorm}.  Finally, we close the section by giving a
complete proof of finiteness of the class group, but leave an explicit
upper bound as an exercise in calculus.  In Section~\ref{sec:cn1} we
very briefly discuss how often number fields have class number 1.
Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:comcg} we further discuss how to compute
class groups, though nothing we do in this book begins to approach the
state of the art regarding such computations -- for that, see Cohen's
books.

\section{The Class Group}\label{sec:theclassgroup}
\begin{definition}[Class Group]
Let $\O_K$ be the ring of integers of a number field~$K$.  The
\defn{class group} $C_K$ of~$K$ is the group of fractional ideals
modulo the subgroup of principal fractional ideals $(a)$, for $a\in K$.
\end{definition}

Note that if we let $\Div(\O_K)$ denote the group of  fractional
ideals, then we have an exact sequence
$$
  0 \to \O_K^* \to K^* \to \Div(\O_K) \to C_K \to 0.
$$
That the class group $C_K$ is finite follows from the first part of
the following theorem and that there are only finitely many
ideals of norm less than a given integer (Proposition~\ref{prop:finitewithnorm}).
\begin{theorem}[Finiteness of the Class Group]\label{thm:finiteclassgrp}
\ithm{finiteness of class group}
Let $K$ be a number field.  There is a constant $C_{r,s}$ that
depends only on the number $r$, $s$ of real and pairs
of complex conjugate embeddings of~$K$, respectively, such that
every ideal class of $\O_K$ contains an integral ideal
of norm at most $C_{r,s}\sqrt{|d_K|}$, where
$d_K=\Disc(\O_K)$.
Thus by Proposition~\ref{prop:finitewithnorm}
the class group $C_K$ of~$K$ is
finite.
In fact, one can take
$$C_{r,s} = \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^s\frac{n!}{n^n}.$$
\end{theorem}
The explicit bound in the theorem
$$M_K = \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^s\frac{n!}{n^n} \cdot \sqrt{|d_K|}$$
is called the \defn{Minkowski
  bound}.  There are other better bounds, but they depend on unproven
conjectures.

The following two examples illustrate how to apply
Theorem~\ref{thm:finiteclassgrp} to compute $C_K$ in
simple cases.
\begin{example}
Let $K=\Q[i]$.  Then $n=2$, $s=1$, and $|d_K|=4$, so the Minkowski bound is
$$
\sqrt{4} \cdot \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^1 \frac{2!}{2^2}
  = \frac{4}{\pi} < 2.
$$
Thus every fractional ideal is equivalent to an ideal of norm~$1$.
Since $(1)$ is the only ideal of norm $1$, every ideal is principal,
so $C_K$ is trivial.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $K=\Q(\sqrt{10})$.
We have $\O_K = \Z[\sqrt{10}]$,
so $n=2$, $s=0$, $|d_K| = 40$, and the
Minkowski bound is
$$
  \sqrt{40}\cdot \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^0 \cdot \frac{2!}{2^2}
  = 2\cdot \sqrt{10} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{10} = 3.162277\ldots.
$$
We compute the Minkowski bound in \sage as follows:
\begin{sagecode}
\begin{sagecell}
K = QQ[sqrt(10)]; K
\end{sagecell}
\begin{sageout}
Number Field in sqrt10 with defining polynomial x^2 - 10
\end{sageout}
\begin{sagecell}
B = K.minkowski_bound(); B
\end{sagecell}
\begin{sageout}
sqrt(10)
\end{sageout}
\begin{sagecell}
B.n()
\end{sagecell}
\begin{sageout}
3.16227766016838
\end{sageout}
\end{sagecode}
Theorem~\ref{thm:finiteclassgrp} implies that every ideal class has a
representative that is an integral ideal of norm~$1$,~$2$, or~$3$.
The ideal $2\O_K$ is ramified in $\O_K$, so
$$
  2\O_K = (2,\sqrt{10})^2.
$$
If $(2,\sqrt{10})$ were principal, say $(\alpha)$, then
$\alpha=a+b\sqrt{10}$ would have norm $\pm 2$.
Then the equation
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:norm10}
  x^2 - 10y^2 = \pm 2,
\end{equation}
would have an integer solution.  But the squares mod~$5$ are
$0,\pm 1$, so (\ref{eqn:norm10}) has no solutions.
Thus $(2,\sqrt{10})$ defines a nontrivial element of the class group,
and it has order~$2$ since its square is the principal ideal $2\O_K$.
Thus $2\mid \#C_K$.

To find the integral ideals of norm $3$, we
factor $x^2-10$ modulo~$3$, and see that
$$
  3\O_K  = (3,2+\sqrt{10}) \cdot (3,4+\sqrt{10}).
$$
If either of the prime divisors of $3\O_K$ were principal,
then the equation $x^2-10y^2 = \pm 3$ would have an integer
solution.  Since it does not have one mod~$5$, the prime divisors
of $3\O_K$ are both nontrivial elements of the class
group.
Let
$$
  \alpha = \frac{4+\sqrt{10}}{2+\sqrt{10}} = \frac{1}{3}\cdot (1+\sqrt{10}).
$$
Then
$$
(3,2+\sqrt{10})\cdot (\alpha) =  (3\alpha, 4+\sqrt{10})
                        =  (1+\sqrt{10}, 4+\sqrt{10})
                        =  (3, 4+\sqrt{10}),
$$
so the classes over~$3$ are equal.

In summary, we now know that every element of $C_K$ is equivalent to one of
$$
    (1),\quad (2,\sqrt{10}), \quad \text{ or } \quad (3,2+\sqrt{10}).
$$
Thus the class group is a group of order at most $3$ that contains an
element of order~$2$.  Thus it must have order~$2$.  We verify this in
\sage below, where we also check that $(3, 2+\sqrt{10})$ generates the
class group.
\begin{sagecode}
\begin{sagecell}
K.<sqrt10> = QQ[sqrt(10)]; K
\end{sagecell}
\begin{sageout}

\begin{sagecell}
G.0 == G( (3, 2 + sqrt10) )
\end{sagecell}
\begin{sageout}
True
\end{sageout}
\end{sagecode}
\end{example}

Before proving Theorem~\ref{thm:finiteclassgrp}, we prove a few
lemmas.  The strategy of the proof is to start with any nonzero
ideal~$I$, and prove that there is some nonzero $a\in K$ having very
small norm, such that $aI$ is an integral ideal. Then
$\Norm(aI)=\Norm_{K/\Q}(a)\Norm(I)$ will be small, since
$\Norm_{K/\Q}(a)$ is small.  The trick is to determine precisely
how small an $a$ we can choose subject to the condition that
$aI$ is an integral ideal, i.e., that $a\in I^{-1}$.

Let $S$ be a subset of $V=\R^n$.  Then $S$ is \defn{convex} if
whenever $x,y\in S$ then the line connecting $x$ and $y$ lies entirely
in $S$.  We say that $S$ is \defn{symmetric about the origin} if
whenever $x\in S$ then $-x\in S$ also.  If $L$ is a lattice in the
real vector space $V=\R^n$, then the \defn{volume} of $V/L$ is the
volume of the compact real manifold $V/L$, which is the same thing as
the absolute value of the determinant of any matrix whose rows form a
basis for~$L$.
\begin{lemma}[Blichfeld]\label{lem:blichfeld}\ilem{Blichfeld}
Let $L$ be a lattice in $V=\R^n$, and let $S$ be a
bounded closed convex subset of $V$ that is symmetric about the
origin.  If
$\Vol(S)\geq 2^n \Vol(V/L),$
then~$S$ contains a nonzero element of $L$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
First assume that $\Vol(S)>2^n \Vol(V/L)$.
If the map $\pi: \frac{1}{2}S \to V/L$ is injective, then
$$\frac{1}{2^n}\Vol(S) = \Vol\left(\frac{1}{2} S\right)\leq \Vol(V/L),$$
a contradiction.  Thus $\pi$ is not injective, so there
exist $P_1\neq P_2\in \frac{1}{2}S$ such that $P_1-P_2\in L$.
Because $S$ is symmetric about the origin, $-P_2\in \frac{1}{2}S$.  By convexity,
the average $\frac{1}{2}(P_1-P_2)$ of $P_1$ and $-P_2$
is also in $\frac{1}{2}S$.  Thus $0\neq P_1-P_2 \in S\meet L$,
as claimed.

Next assume that $\Vol(S) = 2^n\cdot \Vol(V/L)$.  Then for all
$\eps>0$ there is $0\neq Q_\eps \in L\meet (1+\eps) S$,
since $\Vol((1+\eps)S)>\Vol(S)=2^n\cdot \Vol(V/L)$.
If $\eps<1$ then the $Q_\eps$ are all in $L\meet{} 2 S$,
which is finite since $2S$ is bounded and $L$ is discrete.
Hence there exists nonzero $Q=Q_\eps\in L\meet{} (1+\eps) S$ for arbitrarily
small $\eps$.  Since $S$ is closed, $Q\in L\cap S$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:latticevolchange}\ilem{lattices and volumes}
If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are lattices in $V$, then
\[
   \Vol(V/L_2) = \Vol(V/L_1) \cdot [L_1:L_2].
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $A$ be an automorphism of~$V$ such that $A(L_1)=L_2$.  Then~$A$
defines an isomorphism of real manifolds $V/L_1\to V/L_2$ that changes
volume by a factor of $\left|\det(A)\right|=[L_1:L_2]$.  The claimed
formula then follows, since $[L_1:L_2] = \left|\det(A)\right|$, by definition.
\end{proof}

Fix a number field $K$ with ring of integers $\O_K$.
Let $\sigma_1,\ldots, \sigma_r$ be the real embeddings
of $K$ and $\sigma_{r+1},\ldots, \sigma_{r+s}$ be half
the complex embeddings of $K$, with one representative of
each pair of complex conjugate embeddings.
Let $\sigma:K \to V=\R^n$ be the embedding
\begin{align*}
  \sigma(x) = \big(&\sigma_1(x), \sigma_2(x),\ldots, \sigma_r(x),\\
     &\quad \Re(\sigma_{r+1}(x)), \ldots, \Re(\sigma_{r+s}(x)),
      \Im(\sigma_{r+1}(x)), \ldots, \Im(\sigma_{r+s}(x))\big),
\end{align*}
\begin{warning}
Note that this $\sigma$ is {\em not} exactly the same as the one
at the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:disc} if $s>0$.
\end{warning}
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:volok}\ilem{volume of rings of integers}
Let $\sigma$ be the map described above. Then
\[
  \Vol(V/\sigma(\O_K)) = 2^{-s} \sqrt{\left|d_K\right|}.
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $L=\sigma(\O_K)$.
From a basis $w_1,\ldots, w_n$ for $\O_K$ we obtain a matrix $A$
whose $i$th row is
\[
(\sigma_1(w_i), \cdots, \sigma_r(w_i),
\Re(\sigma_{r+1}(w_i)),\ldots, \Re(\sigma_{r+s}(w_i)),
\Im(\sigma_{r+1}(w_i)),\ldots, \Im(\sigma_{r+s}(w_i)))
\]
and whose determinant has absolute value equal to the volume
of $V/L$.  By doing the following three column operations,
we obtain a matrix whose rows are exactly the images of
the $w_i$ under {\em all} embeddings of $K$ into $\C$, which
is the matrix that came up when we defined
$d_K=\Disc(\O_K)$ in Section~\ref{sec:disc}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Add $i=\sqrt{-1}$ times each column with entries $\Im(\sigma_{r+j}(w_i))$
to the column with entries $\Re(\sigma_{r+j}(w_i))$.
\item Multiply all columns with entries $\Im(\sigma_{r+j}(w_i))$
  by $-2i$, thus changing the determinant by $(-2i)^s$.
\item Add each column that now has entries
$\Re(\sigma_{r+j}(w_i))+i\Im(\sigma_{r+j}(w_i))$
to the column with entries $-2i\Im(\sigma_{r+j}(w_i))$
to obtain columns $\Re(\sigma_{r+j}(w_i))-i\Im(\sigma_{r+j}(w_i))$.
\end{enumerate}
Recalling the definition of discriminant, we see that if~$B$
is the matrix constructed by doing the above three
operations to $A$, then $\left|\det(B)^2\right| = \left|d_K\right|$.
Thus
\[
  \Vol(V/L) = \left|\det(A)\right| = \left|(-2i)^{-s}\cdot \det(B)\right| = 2^{-s}\sqrt{\left|d_K\right|}.
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:volfracideal}\ilem{fractional ideal is lattice}
If~$I$ is a  fractional $\O_K$-ideal, then $\sigma(I)$ is
a lattice in~$V$ and
\[
\Vol(V/\sigma(I)) = 2^{-s}\sqrt{|d_K|}\cdot \Norm(I).
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since $\sigma(\O_K)$ has rank $n$ as an abelian group, and
Lemma~\ref{lem:volok} implies that $\sigma(\O_K)$ also spans $V$,
it follows that $\sigma(\O_K)$ is a lattice in $V$.
For some nonzero integer $m$ we have
$m\O_K \subset I \subset \frac{1}{m}\O_K$,
so $\sigma(I)$ is also a lattice in~$V$.
To prove the displayed volume
formula, combine Lemmas
\ref{lem:latticevolchange} and \ref{lem:volok} to get
\[
\Vol(V/\sigma(I)) = \Vol(V/\sigma(\O_K))\cdot[\O_K:I]
         =2^{-s}\sqrt{|d_K|}\Norm(I).
\]
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:finiteclassgrp}]
Let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $\O_K$,
let $\sigma:K\hra V\isom \R^n$ be as above,
and let $f:V\to \R$ be the function defined by
\[
  f(x_1,\ldots, x_n) = |x_1\cdots x_r\cdot (x_{r+1}^2 + x_{(r+1)+s}^2)\cdots (x_{r+s}^2 + x_n^2)|.
\]
Notice that if $x\in K$ then $f(\sigma(x)) = |\Norm_{K/\Q}(x)|$,
and for any $a\in \R$,
 $$
  f(ax_1, \ldots,  ax_n) = |a|^n f(x_1,\ldots, x_n).
$$

Let $S\subset V$ be any fixed choice of closed, bounded, convex, subset with
positive volume that is symmetric with respect to the origin.
Since~$S$ is closed and bounded,
\[
  M = \max\{f(x) : x \in S\}
\]
exists.

Suppose~$I$ is any  fractional ideal of $\O_K$.  Our goal
is to prove that there is an integral ideal $aI$ with small norm. We
will do this by finding an appropriate $a\in I^{-1}$.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:volfracideal},
\[
 c=\Vol(V/\sigma(I^{-1})) = 2^{-s}\sqrt{|d_K|}\cdot \Norm(I)^{-1}
        = \frac{2^{-s} \sqrt{|d_K|}}{\Norm(I)}.
\]
Let $\lambda = 2\cdot\left(\frac{c}{v}\right)^{1/n}$, where $v=\Vol(S)$.
Then
\[
   \Vol(\lambda{} S) = \lambda^n \Vol(S) = 2^n\cdot \frac{c}{v} \cdot v = 2^n\cdot c=
  2^n \Vol(V/\sigma(I^{-1})),
\]
so by Lemma~\ref{lem:blichfeld} there exists
$0\neq b\in \sigma(I^{-1})\meet \lambda S$.
Let $a \in I^{-1}$ be such that $\sigma(a)=b$.
Since~$M$ is the largest norm of an element of~$S$, the largest norm
of an element of $\sigma(I^{-1})\cap  \lambda{}S$ is at most $\lambda^n M$,
so
\[
  \left|\Norm_{K/\Q}(a)\right| \leq \lambda^n M.
\]
Since $a\in I^{-1}$, we have $aI \subset \O_K$, so
$aI$ is an integral ideal of $\O_K$ that is equivalent to $I$, and
\begin{align*}
  \Norm(aI) &= \left|\Norm_{K/\Q}(a)\right|\cdot \Norm(I)\\
    &\leq \lambda^n M\cdot \Norm(I)\\
    &\leq 2^n \frac{c}{v} M \cdot \Norm(I)\\
    &= 2^n\cdot 2^{-s} \sqrt{|d_K|} \cdot M \cdot v^{-1}\\
    &= 2^{r+s} \sqrt{|d_K|} \cdot M \cdot v^{-1}.
\end{align*}
Notice that the right hand side is independent of $I$.  It
depends only on $r$, $s$, $|d_K|$, and our choice of~$S$.
This completes the proof of the theorem, except for
the assertion that $S$ can be chosen to give the claim
at the end of the theorem which is shown in Exercise~\ref{ex:canchooseSright}.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}\label{ex:canchooseSright}
Show that in the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:finiteclassgrp},
$S$ can be chosen so that the final bound matches the statement
of the theorem. This means $S$ can be chosen so that
$$
\Norm(aI) \leq \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^s \frac{n!}{n^n}\sqrt{\left|d_K\right|}.
$$
\begin{hint}
	Consider the subset $S$ of $\R^n$ defined by
	$$
		|x_1| + \cdots + |x_r| + 2\left(\sqrt{
		x_{r+1}^2+x_{(r+1)+s}^2} + \cdots + \sqrt{
		x_{r+s}^2+x_{(r+s)+s}^2}\right) \leq 1.
	$$
	Suppose $a\in\O_K$ such that $\sigma(a)\in S$.
	What can you say about $\Norm_{K/\Q}(a)$? What is $\Vol(S)$?
\end{hint}
\end{exercise}

\begin{corollary}\icor{discrimant of number field $>1$}\label{co:disc>1}
Suppose that $K\neq \Q$ is a number field.  Then $|d_K|>1$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Applying Theorem~\ref{thm:finiteclassgrp} to the unit ideal,
we get the bound
\[
 1\leq \sqrt{|d_K|}\cdot \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^s\frac{n!}{n^n}.
\]
Thus
\[
 \sqrt{|d_K|}
  \geq
\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^s\frac{n^n}{n!},
\]
and the right hand quantity is strictly bigger than $1$ for
any $s\leq n/2$ and any $n>1$, see Exercise~\ref{ex:basicKbound}.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}\label{ex:basicKbound}
Prove the statement at the end of the proof for Corollary~\ref{co:disc>1}, i.e. suppose $n>1$ and $s\leq \frac{n}{2}$ as above. Show that
$
\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^s\frac{n^n}{n!} > 1.
$
\end{exercise}

A prime $p$ ramifies in $\O_K$ if and only if $d\mid d_K$,
so the corollary implies that every nontrivial extension of $\Q$
is ramified at some prime.

\section{Class Number 1}\label{sec:cn1}
The fields of class number 1 are exactly the fields for
which $\O_K$ is a principal ideal domain.  How many such
number fields are there?   We still don't know.
\begin{conjecture}
  There are infinitely many number fields~$K$ such that the class
  group of~$K$ has order~$1$.
\end{conjecture}
For example, if we consider real quadratic fields $K=\Q(\sqrt{d})$,
with $d$ positive and square free, many class numbers are probably $1$,
as suggested by the \sage{} output below.
It looks like 1's will keep appearing infinitely often, and indeed
Cohen and Lenstra conjecture that they do
(\cite{cohen-lenstra:heuristics}).\footnote{Specifically, Cohen and
Lenstra conjecture that $75.446\dots\%$ of real quadratic fields
with prime discriminant have class number $1$.}

\end{sagecode}
In contrast, if we look at class numbers of quadratic imaginary fields,
only a few at the beginning have class number~$1$.
\begin{sagecode}
\begin{sagecell}
for d in [-1,-2..-1000]:
    if is_fundamental_discriminant(d):
        h = QuadraticField(d, 'a').class_number()
        if h == 1:
            print d

\end{sageout}
\end{sagecode}
It is a theorem that was proved independently and in different ways by
Heegner, Stark, and Baker that the above list of $9$ fields is the
complete list with class number~$1$.  More generally, it is possible,
using deep work of Gross, Zagier, and Goldfeld involving zeta
functions and elliptic curves, to enumerate all quadratic number
fields with a given class number (Mark Watkins has done very
substantial work in this direction).

% The function in PARI for computing the order of the class group of a
% quadratic field in PARI is called {\tt qfbclassno}.
% \begin{verbatim}
% ?qfbclassno
%  qfbclassno(x,{flag=0}): class number of discriminant x using
%  Shanks's method by default. If (optional) flag is set to 1,
%  use Euler products.
% ? for(d=2,1000, if(isfundamental(d), h=qfbclassno(d);if(h==1,print1(d,", "))))
% 5, 8, 12, 13, 17, 21, 24, ... 977, 989, 997,

% ? for(d=-1000,-1,if(isfundamental(d), h=qfbclassno(d);if(h==1,print1(d,", "))))
% -163, -67, -43, -19, -11, -8, -7, -4, -3
% \end{verbatim}
% PARI does the above class number computations {\em vastly}
% faster than MAGMA.   However, note the following ominous warning
% in the PARI manual, which has been there in some form since 1997:
% \begin{quote}

\section{More About Computing Class Groups}\label{sec:comcg}
If $\p$ is a prime of $\O_K$, then the intersection $\p\cap \Z$ is
a prime ideal of $\Z$, and equals $p\Z$ if $\p$ is nonzero.  
We say that $\p$ \defn{lies over} $p\in\Z$. Note $\p$ lies over 
$p\in\Z$ if and only if $\p$ is one of the prime factors in the 
factorization of the ideal $p\O_K$.  Geometrically, $\p$ is a point 
of $\Spec(\O_K)$ that lies over the point $p\Z$ of $\Spec(\Z)$ under 
the map induced by the inclusion $\Z\hra \O_K$ as described in 
Section~\ref{sec:geom_intuition}.


\begin{lemma}\ilem{class group generated by bounded primes}
Let $K$ be a number field with ring of integers $\O_K$.  Then the
class group $\Cl(K)$ is generated by the prime ideals $\p$ of $\O_K$
lying over primes $p\in\Z$ with $p\leq B_K = \sqrt{|d_K|}\cdot
\left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^s\cdot \frac{n!}{n^n}$,
where $s$ is the number of complex conjugate pairs of embeddings
$K\hra\C$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Theorem~\ref{thm:finiteclassgrp}
asserts that every ideal class in $\Cl(K)$ is represented by
an ideal~$I$ with $\Norm(I)\leq B_K$.  Write $I=\prod_{i=1}^m
\p_i^{e_i}$, with each $e_i\geq 1$.  Then by multiplicativity of the
norm, each $\p_i$ also satisfies $\Norm(\p_i)\leq B_K$.  If $\p_i \cap
\Z=p\Z$, then $p\mid \Norm(\p_i)$, since $p$ is the residue
characteristic of $\O_K/\p$, so $p\leq B_K$. Thus~$I$ is a product of
primes~$\p$ that satisfies the norm bound of the lemma.
\end{proof}

This is a sketch of how to compute $\Cl(K)$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the algorithms of Chapter~\ref{ch:factoring_primes} to list all
prime ideals $\p$ of $\O_K$ that appear in the factorization
of a prime $p\in \Z$ with $p\leq B_K$.
\item Find the group generated  by the ideal
classes $[\p]$, where the $\p$ are the prime ideals
found in step 1.  (In general, this step can become
fairly complicated.)
\end{enumerate}
The following three examples illustrate computation of $\Cl(K)$
for $K=\Q(i), \Q(\sqrt{5})$ and $\Q(\sqrt{-6})$.
\begin{example}
We compute the class group of $K=\Q(i)$.  We have
$$
  n = 2, \quad r=0, \quad s=1, \quad d_K = -4,
$$
so
$$
  B_K = \sqrt{4}\cdot \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^1
   \cdot\left(\frac{2!}{2^2}\right) = \frac{8}{\pi} <3.
$$
Thus $\Cl(K)$ is generated by the prime divisors
of $2$.  We have
$$
 2\O_K = (1+i)^2,
$$
so $\Cl(K)$ is generated by the principal prime
ideal $\p=(1+i)$. Thus $\Cl(K)=1$ is trivial.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
We compute the class group of $K=\Q(\sqrt{5})$.
We have
$$
  n = 2, \quad r = 2, \quad s=0, \quad d_K = 5,
$$
so $$B = \sqrt{5}\cdot \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^0\cdot
\left(\frac{2!}{2^2}\right)  < 3.$$
Thus $\Cl(K)$ is generated by the primes that divide $2$.
We have $\O_K=\Z[\gamma]$, where $\gamma=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$
satisfies $x^2-x-1$.   The polynomial $x^2-x-1$ is irreducible
mod $2$, so $2\O_K$ is prime.  Since it is principal, we see
that $\Cl(K)=1$ is trivial.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
In this example, we compute the class group of $K=\Q(\sqrt{-6})$.
We have
$$
  n = 2, \quad r=0, \quad s=1, \quad d_K = -24,
$$
so
$$
  B = \sqrt{24} \cdot \frac{4}{\pi} \cdot
       \left(\frac{2!}{2^2}\right)\sim 3.1.
$$
Thus $\Cl(K)$ is generated by the prime ideals lying over $2$ and $3$.
We have $\O_K=\Z[\sqrt{-6}]$, and $\sqrt{-6}$ satisfies $x^2+6=0$.
Factoring $x^2+6$ modulo $2$ and $3$ we see that the class group
is generated by the prime ideals
$$
  \p_2 = (2,\sqrt{-6})\qquad\text{and}\qquad
  \p_3 = (3,\sqrt{-6}).
$$
Also, $\p_2^2 = 2\O_K$ and $\p_3^2=3\O_K$, so
$\p_2$ and $\p_3$ define elements of order
dividing $2$ in $\Cl(K)$.

Is either $\p_2$ or $\p_3$ principal?  Fortunately,
there is an easier norm trick that allows us to decide.
Suppose $\p_2 = (\alpha)$, where $\alpha=a+b\sqrt{-6}$.
Then $$2=\Norm(\p_2) = \left|\Norm(\alpha)\right| = (a+b\sqrt{-6})(a-b\sqrt{-6})
   = a^2 + 6b^2.$$
Trying the first few values of $a, b\in \Z$, we see that this
equation has no solutions, so $\p_2$ can not
be principal.  By a similar argument, we see that $\p_3$
is not principal either.  Thus $\p_2$ and $\p_3$ define
elements of order $2$ in $\Cl(K)$.

Does the class of $\p_2$ equal the class of $\p_3$?
Since $\p_2$ and $\p_3$ define classes of order~$2$,
we can decide this by finding the class of $\p_2\cdot \p_3$.
We have
$$
 \p_2\cdot \p_3 =  (2,\sqrt{-6})\cdot (3,\sqrt{-6})
   = (6,2\sqrt{-6}, 3\sqrt{-6}) \subset (\sqrt{-6}).$$
The ideals on both sides of the inclusion have norm $6$,
so by multiplicativity of the norm, they must be the
same ideal.  Thus $\p_2\cdot \p_3=(\sqrt{-6})$ is principal,
which shows $\p_3$ is the inverse of $\p_2$ in $\Cl(K)$. But
$\p_2$ had order $2$,
so $\p_2$ and $\p_3$ represent the same element of $\Cl(K)$.
We conclude that $$\Cl(K) = \langle \p_2 \rangle = \Z/2\Z.$$
